## 📚 Student Portal

Original features maintained:
- Added a reusable header (`studentheader.html`) and created `include-html.js` to inject it into each page.
- Added `styles.css` for shared styling.
- Updated each page to include `header placeholder`, `styles.css` and the header injector script.
- Dashboard (`studentdashboard.html`) now displays a grid of card links to the major pages and has sidebar buttons linked to full pages.
- `login.html` now stores a mock user in `localStorage` and redirects to the dashboard; header shows logged in name.
- Header has a nav with links to all pages and a small active-link highlight.

How to run locally (recommended):
- The header is injected via `fetch`, so opening files with `file://` may cause network restrictions. Use a simple static server.

Using Python (3.x):
```
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\HImanshu\2.0
python -m http.server 8000
```

Using `http-server` (Node.js):
```
npm i -g http-server
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\HImanshu\2.0
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/homepage.html (or any page) in your browser.

Notes & next steps:
- You might want to move header styles into a separate `styles.css` and reduce duplication.
- Add server-side session handling (if needed) and replace `localStorage`-based mock login with a real auth flow.
- The header HTML is kept in `studentheader.html` and is injected into all pages to keep things DRY.

Enjoy! 🎓

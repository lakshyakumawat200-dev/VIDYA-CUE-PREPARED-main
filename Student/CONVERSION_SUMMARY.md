## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```javascript
app.state = {
    currentPage: 'dashboard',
    theme: 'light',
    sidebarOpen: true,
    qrCodeUrl: null,
    assignments: [],
    attendanceList: []
}
```

### Page Rendering System
```javascript
// Switch-case based page rendering
app.renderPage('dashboard') → pages.renderDashboard()
app.renderPage('assignments') → pages.renderAssignments()
// etc...
```

### Component Building
```javascript
// Reusable component functions
components.createCard()
components.createStatCard()
components.createTable()
components.createAssignmentCard()
components.createModal()
```

### CSS Variable System
```css
:root {
    --primary: #2563eb;
    --background: #ffffff;
    --foreground: #0f172a;
    --muted: #f1f5f9;
    /* 15+ variables for theming */
}
```
